# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to practice using server-side APIs and dynamically displaying the data on a web browser.

## Instructions
The user is presented with a website that says Weather Dashboard on the top. The are presented with an input space and a search button with instructions to enter a city name. Once user enters a city name:
* They are presented with the current city name, date, weather icon, temperature in Celcius, wind speed in km/h, humidity, and UV index that is color coded to display green for low, yellow for moderate, and red for high.
* Below the current data, the user can see the weather for that city up to five days with information such as date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
* Below the search button, the user can see that the city that they searched for has appeared as a gray button. 
* The user can click this button which will bring the weather data for that city again.
* If the user closes the website/browser, the search information has been preserved in local storage.
* If the user navigates back to the weather dashboard, below the search button, they are able to see what they searched during last session.

## Future Considerations
In the future, a filter can be introduced to filter the city names, since there are multiple countries with similar or same city name.
